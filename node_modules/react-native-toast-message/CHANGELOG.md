Headers are one of:

## [2.1.6]

### Fixed

- Inline docs for `visibilityTime`. The value is in milliseconds, not seconds; by [johnbillion](https://github.com/johnbillion) in [#429](https://github.com/calintamas/react-native-toast-message/pull/429)

## [2.1.5]

### Fixed

- chore(deps): bump ansi-regex from 4.1.0 to 4.1.1 by [dependabot](https://github.com/dependabot) in [#343](https://github.com/calintamas/react-native-toast-message/pull/343)

## [2.1.4]

### Fixed

- fix: delay after keyboard is dismissed by [rcb4t2](https://github.com/rcb4t2) in [#342](https://github.com/calintamas/react-native-toast-message/pull/342)

## [2.1.3]

### Fixed

- chore(deps): bump minimist from 1.2.5 to 1.2.6 by [dependabot](https://github.com/dependabot) in [#338](https://github.com/calintamas/react-native-toast-message/pull/338)

## [2.1.2]

### Fixed

- Fixes `useNativeDriver` warning on web by [jpaas](https://github.com/jpaas) in [#334](https://github.com/calintamas/react-native-toast-message/pull/334)

## [2.1.1]

### Fixed

- Tapping a View / Button behind the Toast is not possible ([b9d191e](https://github.com/calintamas/react-native-toast-message/commit/b9d191e1dcc4d331fd5159ca9aabd54d7d0ecb97)) (fixes [#282](https://github.com/calintamas/react-native-toast-message/issues/282))

## [2.1.0]

### Fixed

- After a Toast is shown within a Modal, the main instance outside of Modal doesn't work anymore ([#293](https://github.com/calintamas/react-native-toast-message/pull/293))
- A previously set timer is not cleared when `autoHide` changes from `true` to `false`. This can make a newly shown Toast auto hide (even if it was shown with `autoHide: false`) ([#294](https://github.com/calintamas/react-native-toast-message/pull/294))

  Big thanks go to [jstheoriginal](https://github.com/jstheoriginal) for all the work on fixing the two issues above üôå.

- Flexbox not working for setting Toast width or alignment ([3400f00](https://github.com/calintamas/react-native-toast-message/commit/3400f0074116f5acb37ca2eb696ea50b0c669ddc))

### Changed

- `BaseToastProps` style types allows passing an array of styles now `style={[styles.one, styles.two]}` ([#243](https://github.com/calintamas/react-native-toast-message/pull/243) was ported to v2)
- Peer deps no longer require a min version ([e91ed21](https://github.com/calintamas/react-native-toast-message/commit/e91ed21d277d7348b674834765147be752b6abfb))

## [2.0.2]

### Fixed

- Fast swipe up re-creates the toast [#280](https://github.com/calintamas/react-native-toast-message/issues/280)

## [2.0.1]

### Fixed

- `ansi-regex` vulnerability by upgrading to `@testing-library/jest-native v4.0.4` ([#277](https://github.com/calintamas/react-native-toast-message/pull/277))

## [2.0.0]

### Breaking

- Setting the `ref` is no longer required when rendering the `Toast` component in your app's entry point. Ref storage is now handled internally using [React.createRef](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactcreateref). This should improve ref access reliability at runtime.

  ```js
    // App.jsx
    import Toast from 'react-native-toast-message';

    export function App(props) {
      return (
        <>
          {/* ... */}
          <Toast />
        </>
      );
    }
  ```

- When you want to have the Toast visible inside a Modal, you no longer need to set a separate `ref`.

  Simply render the `Toast` component inside the Modal, as well as in your app's entry point. When the Modal is visible, the `ref` from inside the Modal will be automatically used.

- `onHide` callback is now always called when the Toast hides (does not matter if `autoHide` was `true` / `false`).

- `inProgress` state has been removed and can no longer be relied upon in a custom Toast config.

- `style` and `height` props from the Toast component were removed; with the purpose of achieving a cleaner API design. The only way to change the style / layout of different Toast types is through the `config` prop (fixes [#204](https://github.com/calintamas/react-native-toast-message/issues/204)).

### Added

- on the `BaseToast` component, the following props were added: `touchableContainerProps`, `contentContainerProps`, `text1Props`, `text2Props` , `text1NumberOfLines`, `text2NumberOfLines` (fixes [#112](https://github.com/calintamas/react-native-toast-message/issues/112), [#133](https://github.com/calintamas/react-native-toast-message/issues/133)).

- on the `Toast` component, the following callbacks were added as props: `onShow` , `onHide` and `onPress` (fixes [#143](https://github.com/calintamas/react-native-toast-message/issues/143)).

- A new `ToastShowParams` type is exported (fixes [#192](https://github.com/calintamas/react-native-toast-message/issues/192)).

### Changed

- `topOffset` and `bottomOffset` are now by default `40px`
- New test ids on `BaseToast` component: `toastTouchableContainer`, `toastContentContainer`, `toastText1` and `toastText2`.

### Removed

- Success, error and info leading icons were removed from the package (to make it as lightweight as possible).

  It's now possible to pass them via render functions (for more flexibility, see issues regarding svg support, using components as icons, etc) on `BaseToast` component, example below:

  ```js
  const toastConfig = {
    success: (props) => (
      <BaseToast
        {...props}
        renderLeadingIcon={() => <Image />}
        renderTrailingIcon={() => <Image />}
      />
    )
  }
  ```

  Fixes [#188](https://github.com/calintamas/react-native-toast-message/issues/188), [#203](https://github.com/calintamas/react-native-toast-message/issues/203), [#245](https://github.com/calintamas/react-native-toast-message/issues/245), [#250](https://github.com/calintamas/react-native-toast-message/issues/250).

- Trailing close icon has been removed from default components `BaseToast`, `SuccessToast`, `ErrorToast` and `InfoToast`. Fixes [#167](https://github.com/calintamas/react-native-toast-message/issues/167).
